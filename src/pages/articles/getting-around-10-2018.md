It's a Saturday and you want to get around New York City, but the F train is making stops along the D in Brooklyn and the E in Manhattan, the 2 and 3 aren't running south of Chambers St., and signal problems have torpedoed service along the N, R, and Q trains. Or it's a Tuesday morning and, well, have you noticed that the MTA melts down every during any hour that might have a shot at being considered be rush hour? The subway isn't what it once was, and short, easy trips are often infuriatingly unreliable. But the subway isn't the be-all and end-all of travel in New York City. Anyone looking to get around town, with or without the subways, has plenty of low-cost, versatile options in 2018, and most won't run up against inscrutable delays.

Here’s what’s available to you:

# CITI BIKES

Don't leave the fate of your travel in the hands of the MTA: take to control of it with your feet instead. NYC's bike share program covers most of Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn, Williamsburg and Greenpoint, and western Queens. For $169 a year—not much more than the cost of one 30-day Metrocard—enjoy unlimited 45-minute rides around town and the exercise benefits to boot. Motivate, the bike share's parent company, recently introduced 200 e-bikes into the system, and the lucky riders who can find them can zip around town at nearly 20 miles per hour.

Beware the day pass rates though: a $12 24-hour pass makes Citi Bike an expensive short-term option, and a $3 single-ride charge exceeds the cost of a subway fare. Not to mention that New York drivers remain a safety hazard on the road for any cyclist.
