“Bodies of Work” is a recurring Newest York feature in which we sit down with a local artist or writer to hear in their own words what influences and animates them. This month, we're talking to photographer David Williams of Sunset Park, Brooklyn. He’s a vegetarian of ten years whose images of food (bacon festival included) have been published in the New York Times, The New Yorker, and Village Voice, among others. He also photographs humans and animals – most notably, men and their cats. He and his wife have two of the latter.

\        1. THE WORK OF MARTIN PARR

Martin Parr, the photographer, has shot a ton of food stuff. I have a ton of his books. I feel like he has food in every single one of his books, even if it's not a food book. Think of England (2000) had a lot of food in it and that's definitely the first book that I ever saw of his. Then later on he released a book called Real Food (2016) that's just food photography, like what he's done over the years. I love all of his work, but his food photography has always jumped out at me. It's poppy and colorful and campy.

I got involved in shooting food totally by accident. For one of the first assignments I ever got, I want to say in 2015, I went to Connecticut and shot this woman who lives in a nunnery and makes cheese. There's a great PBS documentary that they did about her called The Cheese Nun (2006). I went there just to shoot a portrait, because that’s what I shot at that point in my career – it's weird saying career because it's only three years ago – but then I also shot some cheese. I shot it how I would shoot my portraits, with one light, just a bright strobe, and then I turned those images in. A month later, the same magazine hired me to shoot this food column for them, which was kind of weird foods, so I went and shot these sea urchins for them at the Greenpoint Fish & Lobster Company, and they said, "Just shoot it how you shoot your portraits." So I showed up, a camera and one light, and put it in some sun to give it this poppy look to it, and they loved it. It just went on from there I guess.
